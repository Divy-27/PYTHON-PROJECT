App Store Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing App Store data to derive meaningful insights about applications' performance, genres, ratings, and supported devices. The analysis involves pre-processing raw data, exploring trends, and extracting insights to better understand the app ecosystem. The project is structured as follows:

Dataset Description
The project utilizes App Store data provided in two CSV files:

AppleStore.csv: Contains detailed information about apps, including genre, size, ratings, supported devices, etc.
AppleStore_description.csv: Contains descriptive information about the apps.
Both datasets are preprocessed and analyzed to derive actionable insights.

Key Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing: Ensures clean and consistent data by handling missing values, duplicates, and data transformations.
Genre Analysis: Identifies app distribution, popularity, and performance metrics across different genres.
App Ratings: Analyzes Free and Paid apps with high ratings to uncover patterns in user preferences.
Device and Language Support: Explores the compatibility of apps with devices and languages, highlighting accessibility and user reach.
Correlation Analysis: Explores relationships between features such as app
size, ratings, and pricing using Pearson Correlation to identify significant patterns and dependencies in the data.

Project Objectives
Gain insights into app categories and their popularity.
Understand user preferences through ratings analysis.
Explore how app characteristics, like size and supported devices, influence ratings.
Identify key factors that differentiate Free and Paid apps.
Highlight trends in multilingual and multi-device support for apps.
