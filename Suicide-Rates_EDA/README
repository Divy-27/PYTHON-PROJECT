Introduction
This project analyzes suicide rates across different demographics and socioeconomic indicators. Using data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, it provides actionable insights to better understand and address this critical issue.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from master.csv. It includes information such as:

Year
Country
Gender
Age group
Suicide rates (per 100k population)
GDP per capita
Human Development Index (HDI)
Data Pre-Processing
To ensure clean and reliable data, the following steps were taken:

Handling Missing Values: Missing data was filled or removed as necessary.
Removing Duplicate Rows: Ensured no duplicate records affected the analysis.
Data Transformation: Converted relevant fields (e.g., size or GDP units) for easier interpretation.
Analysis and Insights
The analysis explores several key areas:

Trends in Suicide Rates:
Variations by gender, age group, and country.
Economic Indicators:
Relationship between GDP, HDI, and suicide rates.
Most Affected Groups:
High-risk demographics such as males aged 35-54.
Regional Analysis:
Countries and regions with the highest and lowest suicide rates.
Correlation Analysis
A Pearson Correlation analysis was conducted to identify relationships between key variables, such as:

Suicide rates and GDP per capita
Age groups and gender impact
Feature Engineering
New features were created to enhance the analysis, such as:

Categorizing countries by income levels.
Aggregating age groups into broader categories.
